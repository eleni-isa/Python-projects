DISCLAIMER: This code is just a presentation for a totally starter, as I am with pandas. For any suggestion, please drop me a line.

While processing huge datasets, Python has provided an easier way to handle them. Instead of using lists and dictionaries, 
there is an easier, faster, convenient and using less memory way to do this. 

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance.

Installation for PhyCharm: 
File -> Setting -> Add new interpreter ->pandas

NumPy is a package for scientific computing with Python.

Same way for installation for PhyCharm.

Basic steps for a data cleaning: 
-import data 
-merge data sets 
-rebuild missing data if possible 
-standardize data 
-normalize data 
-de-duplicate data
-export data 

For presenting this example, I used Jupyter Notebook. For more info: http://jupyter.org/
Download anaconda, open anaconda prompt, type jupyter notebook

I personally created the data set. The initial purpose was something small, so the user can print it and see the results easily. Also, 
the specific data set has some of the most common mistakes that usually happen, so all the process can be presented.
